Install WordPress with Docker Compose

Install Docker Compose

1. Run this command to download the current stable release of Docker Compose:

    sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.27.4/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

2. Apply executable permissions to the binary:

    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

Note: If the command docker-compose fails after installation, check your path. You can also create a symbolic link to /usr/bin or any other directory in your path.

For example:

sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose

   1.Optionally, install command completion for the bash and zsh shell.

   2.Test the installation.

$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.27.4, build 1110ad01

Set Up WordPress:-

 1.Create a new directory in your home folder called my_wordpress and cd into it:

    mkdir ~/my_wordpress/
    cd ~/my_wordpress/
 2.Create a file named docker-compose.yml in this folder and add the following contents. Set your own passwords for the WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD, MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD, and MYSQL_PASSWORD environment options. The password entered for WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD and MYSQL_PASSWORD should be the same.
 
 3. From the my_wordpress directory, start your Docker containers:

      docker-compose up -d    
 
 4.The Docker containers will take a minute or two to start up WordPress and MySQL. Afterwards, you can visit your Linodeâ€™s IP address in your web browser and you should be directed to the WordPress setup form.
